            <p>Colder-than-normal temperatures are expected to remain in Alabama, with a system bringing bitterly cold air into the state next week.

                And the long-range forecasts from the National Weather Service's Climate Prediction Center are calling for the pattern of below-normal conditions to remain in place until Feb. 7, at least.
                
                The average high for Montgomery this time of year is 59, with the average low coming in at 36. Subtract a few degrees from those numbers if you go north. Add a few ticks as you go south.
